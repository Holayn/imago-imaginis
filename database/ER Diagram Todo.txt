Changes to consider (let's discuss these)
Remove paid boolean from Users; keep data in new table
Remove admin boolean from Users; keep data in new table
Consider renaming timestamp property in Photo as name is unclear. Timestamp of what? Perhaps creation_date?
Consider renaming timestamp property in Videos as name is unclear. Timestamp of what? Perhaps creation_date?

Changes made (please update in ER diagram)
Is there a reason password is type CHAR? In the meantime I used type VARCHAR. If this is intended, then update db creation script instead
Changed Filter's name to be of length 15 for uniformity
Changed type of timestamp property in Photos to date for uniformity
Changed type of timestamp property in Videos to date for uniformity
Moved timestamp in Photos to bottom for uniformity
Moved timestamp in Videos to bottom for uniformity

Other stuff:
We need to store the user's email. It's what they sign up with, and they don't create a username. We could change that, ofc.
We also need to store the user's full name. So user_fname and user_lname.
Also, for photos/videos stored, they're photos/videos with the style already transfered, right?
