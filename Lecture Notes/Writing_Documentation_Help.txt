6 Major Steps
1) Planning (know audience, material, purpose, task)
2) Clarity (avoid jargon, define unfamilarities)
3) Brevity (less is more, get to essential message)
4) Simplicity (use details wisely, not too much/little)
5) Language (unnecessary complexity, overuse of pronouns)
6) Active voice (strong verbs, natural sound, flow)

Put pictures and diagrams in documentation

Don't leave documentation to the end!!! Document things as you go.
