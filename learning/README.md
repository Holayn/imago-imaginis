Here is where all of the magic happens.

## Deep Dream

One approach to the deep learning aspect of this project is to use follow the
[Deep Dream demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream)
which Google has provided.  In order to run this locally, save the
[pre-trained net](https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception5h.zip)
into the folder `/pretrained`.
